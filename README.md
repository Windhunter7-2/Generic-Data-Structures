# Generic Data Structures
This is a library of generic data structures. (And, of course, as versions expand, it will include more and/or revised data structures over time)

While things such as JDSL might exist already, a lot of these other extensions have requirements, such as registration, non-commercial use, etc. The idea here is that this will be a library of classes that are easy to use (As easy to use as ArrayList) and generic for all intensive purposes, without these restrictions, due to all my programming projects being open-source. And, since it will use generics, it will allow things as advanced as a single line to create a queue inside a stack, or a BST inside a graphâ€™s node, and things like that.
